## Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance System!

This project provides an efficient face recognition-based attendance system using real-time facial recognition. It integrates with Firebase for storing student data and images and allows for automatic attendance updates based on facial recognition. This system can be used in schools, colleges, or any organization that requires secure and fast attendance tracking.

> **Note**  
> The system runs locally, and all data processing happens on-premise. No data leaves the server.
